# CRUD-API
Implementation of simple CRUD API using in-memory database underneath

**Installation**: 
1. Clone/download the dev branch repo.
2. cd to crud-api folder.
3. Run: npm install
4. Use the Postman application to check the implemented functionality.

**Usage**:
- To set the port, set the value of the SERVER_PORT variable in the .env file

- Development mode: npm run start:dev.
- Production mode: npm run prod:dev.

**Implementation details**:
1. Implemented endpoint api/users:
  - GET api/users is used to get all persons
    - Server should answer with status code 200 and all users records
  - GET api/users/{userId}
    - Server should answer with status code 200 and record with id === userId if it exists
    - Server should answer with status code 400 and corresponding message if userId is invalid (not uuid)
    - Server should answer with status code 404 and corresponding message if record with id === userId doesn't exist
  - POST api/users is used to create record about new user and store it in database
    - Server should answer with status code 201 and newly created record
    - Server should answer with status code 400 and corresponding message if request body does not contain required fields
  - PUT api/users/{userId} is used to update existing user
    - Server should answer with status code 200 and updated record
    - Server should answer with status code 400 and corresponding message if userId is invalid (not uuid)
    - Server should answer with status code 404 and corresponding message if record with id === userId doesn't exist
  - DELETE api/users/{userId} is used to delete existing user from database
    - Server should answer with status code 204 if the record is found and deleted
    - Server should answer with status code 400 and corresponding message if userId is invalid (not uuid)
    - Server should answer with status code 404 and corresponding message if record with id === userId doesn't exist
2. Users are stored as objects that have following properties:
  - id — unique identifier (string, uuid) generated on server side
  - username — user's name (string, required)
  - age — user's age (number, required)
  - hobbies — user's hobbies (array of strings or empty array, required)
3. Requests to non-existing endpoints (e.g. some-non/existing/resource) should be handled (server should answer with status code 404 and corresponding human-friendly message)
4. Errors on the server side that occur during the processing of a request should be handled and processed correctly (server should answer with status code 500 and corresponding human-friendly message)
5. Value of port on which application is running should be stored in .env file
6. There should be 2 modes of running application (development and production):
- The application is run in development mode using nodemon or ts-node-dev (there is a npm script start:dev)
- The application is run in production mode (there is a npm script start:prod that starts the build process and then runs the bundled file)
8. There could be implemented horizontal scaling for application, there should be npm script start:multi that starts multiple instances of your application using the Node.js Cluster API (equal to the number of available parallelism - 1 on the host machine, each listening on port PORT + n) with a load balancer that distributes requests across them (using Round-robin algorithm). For example: available parallelism is 4, PORT is 4000. On run npm run start:multi it works following way
  - On localhost:4000/api load balancer is listening for requests
  - On localhost:4001/api, localhost:4002/api, localhost:4003/api workers are listening for requests from load balancer
  - When user sends request to localhost:4000/api, load balancer sends this request to localhost:4001/api, next user request is sent to localhost:4002/api and so on.
  - After sending request to localhost:4003/api load balancer starts from the first worker again (sends request to localhost:4001/api)
  - State of db should be consistent between different workers, for example:
    - First POST request addressed to localhost:4001/api creates user
    - Second GET request addressed to localhost:4002/api should return created user
    - Third DELETE request addressed to localhost:4003/api deletes created user
    - Fourth GET request addressed to localhost:4001/api should return 404 status code for created user
